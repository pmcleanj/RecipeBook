stopped going &ldquo;home&rdquo; for holidays while I was still in
University. My parents divorced in the summer of 1980, and that
Christmas it became clear that my &ldquo;childhood home&rdquo; simply
didn't exist. Unlike some university students, I did <FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><U>not</U>

my old room kept shrine-like for my return: the house had moved on,
and it was patently time for me to move on, too. The following
Christmas I remember spending Christmas eve watching Kramer vs.
Kramer at the moviedome, and eating Christmas dinner as guest of my
boyfriend's mother. After graduation, I resolved the problem by
cooking holiday dinners myself and sharing them with other young
singles in similar family circumstances. I created <a href="ChristmasDinner1984.html">Christmas

dedicated to my dinner guests of the evening</P>

I married, we carried on the Christmas dinners &ndash; we had always
held them on a later day within the Twelve Days to allow guests to
fulfill family obligations and command performances &ndash; but fell
into the habit of having Thanksgiving dinner with my in-laws. This
year, Dean's parents' travel schedule didn't allow his mother to cook
a large dinner, and in a fit of generosity or lunacy, I volunteered
to cook. So, for Anne and Rachel who will someday be inheriting the
role of cook and chatelaine in this household or in some other, I
offer this collection of recipes.</P>
