title: A Formal Multi-Course Meal
crawlertitle: Logrus - Formal Meals
---
<h4>Always serve an uneven number of courses. The central course, normally the
roast course, is the focus of the meal: serve the same number of
courses before the roast as after; serve the same number of courses
in the salon before the meal, as in the drawing room after the meal.
Alternate sweet or tart dishes with savoury dishes, taking thought to
how each taste transitions to the next.</P>
<h4>The letters after each course heading indicate how fundamental is the
course. Thus, for a three-course meal, use all of the &ldquo;A&rdquo;
courses: Soup, Roast and Dessert. For a 5-course meal, use the &ldquo;A&rdquo;
and &ldquo;B&rdquo;courses: Appetizer, Soup, Roast, Salad, Dessert;
and so on.</P>
<H1>Canapes</A>(C)</H1>
<H1><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Canap&#279;s
are &ldquo;finger-food&rdquo; hors d'Ouevres, being made on top of a
thin slice of firm bread or a cracker. Since they do not require
cutlery, they are properly served in the Salon where guests are
gathering before the meal. Cocktails may be served to drink. The
hostess should strive to be present in the Salon to greet her guests
as they arrive. Four to eight guests, in addition to the host and
hostess, are the perfect number for an intimate formal meal: no more
than the Muses and no fewer than the Graces. If more guests are
expected, the hostess should stand by the door and receive guests as
they arrive, to spare them from having to search her up in the crowd,
and to ensure that they are introduced at once to two or three of
their fellow guests, and provided with refreshments as well as
conversational partners.</H1>
<H1">When all the Guests have arrived, the hostess may announce &ldquo;Dinner
is served&rdquo;, or if she has domestic staff then her head-of-staff
may announce to her &ldquo;Madam is served&rdquo;. Then the hostess,
escorted by the guest of honour, will lead her guests into the dining
room and direct them where to sit. The gentlemen hold chairs for the
ladies, and do not themselves sit down until all the ladies are
seated.</H1>

canap&#279;s may have been served in the Salon, a more substantial
appetizer &ndash; often shellfish such as oysters or shrimp &ndash;
can also be served at the table. The shrimp- or oyster-fork goes to
the right of the spoons in the place setting. (All the other forks
are on the left of the place setting.) The appetizer itself should be
sitting on the service plates when the guests are seated; so a cold
appetizer, not at risk of becoming lukewarm while it waits, is a good
choice.</SPAN></H1>

Americans are so used to restaurants' serving a salad at the start of

you may serve salad instead of soup to avoid confusing your
restaurant-adapted North-American guests, in which case youwill not
of course serve a salad here.</P>

places the bottle on the table to his left. Contrary to the conceit
practiced in some military messes, the port bottle may properly and
should be set down on the table; however no gentlemen should allow it
to remain stalled to his own right just because he himself doesn't
care for any more port. He should in a timely manner pass the bottle
along, even if he does not take the opportunity to refill his glass.</P>
