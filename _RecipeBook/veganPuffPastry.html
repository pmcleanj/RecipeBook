<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">The
second ingredient of vegan pastry is usually given as &ldquo;vegan
margarine&rdquo; -- but no  specification as to just what &ldquo;vegan
margarine&rdquo; is. It can be any combination of oils, that the
manufacturer has somehow contrived to make at least semi-solid.
Finding a margarine that will even vaguely replicate the crisp
flakiness of traditional pastry is a veritable grail quest. I propose
resorting to actual pure, known ingredients instead.</P>
