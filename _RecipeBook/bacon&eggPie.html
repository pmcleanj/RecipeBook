and Egg Pie</H1>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>14
oz packet of puff or flaky pastry <BR>4 to 6 rashers of bacon <BR>6
eggs <BR>&frac12; cup of frozen peas <BR>&frac12; cup of frozen corn
kernels <BR>2 large tomatoes (optional) <BR>salt and pepper to taste</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=2>Preheat
the oven to 200&deg;C, 400&deg;F or gas mark 6. Roll out the pastry
to fit the bottom of a pie or flan dish and put aside enough to cover
the dish. Remove the rind and any excess fat from the bacon. Lay the
bacon on top of the pastry in the dish. Break each egg into a cup and
pour over the bacon. Pierce each yolk with a fork, spreading the egg
around to cover the whole pie base. Sprinkle the frozen vegetables
over the egg and slice the tomatoes and arrange neatly. Season and
cover securely with the pastry lid, crimping the edges. Pierce the
pastry lid with a fork or knife to let any steam escape while the pie
is cooking. Bake for 20 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown.
Seves 4 to 6.</P>
