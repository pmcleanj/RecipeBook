<P><FONT FACE="Apple Chancery"><FONT SIZE=3>If you were thorough
scraping the bowl, then it's clean enough to re-use. So go back to
the beginning and mix up the second cake. It takes about ten minutes,
so the first cake will be half-done when you put the second cake in
the oven, and done completely when you put the third cake in the
oven. If you find you're moving faster than that, slow down and take
a two-minute break between cakes – because the cakes won't bake
evenly if you try to squeeze three of them into the same oven at the
same time.</P>
