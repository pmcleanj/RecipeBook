				<P>A white bread for sandwiches,
				dinner rolls, and toast. This bread is like a brioche, with less
				butter and no egg. It has an even yet open crumb but is softer
				and lighter in texture. Part of the secret of its light texture
				is that, like brioche, it is made from an exceptionally moist
				dough. TIME SCHEDULE <STRONG>Dough

					<P><STRONG>Flour Mixture and Dough</STRONG> 
					</P>
					<P><STRONG>2. Make the flour mixture and add to the sponge.</STRONG>
					In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour (reserve 1/4 cup if
					mixing by hand), dry milk, and instant yeast. Sprinkle this on
					top of the sponge and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Allow it
					to ferment for 1 to 4 hours at room temperature. (During this
					time, the sponge will bubble through the flour blanket in
					places: this is fine.) 
					</P>
					<LI><P><STRONG>3. Mix the dough.</STRONG> 
					</P>
					<LI><P><EM>Mixer Method</EM> Add the butter to the bowl and mix
					with the dough hook on low speed (#2 if using a KitchenAid) for
					1 minute or until the flour is moistened enough to form a rough
					dough. Scrape down any bits of dough. Cover the bowl with
					plastic wrap and allow the dough to rest for 20 minutes. 
					</P>
					<LI><P>Sprinkle on the salt and knead the dough on medium speed
					(#4 KitchenAid) for 7 to 10 minutes. It will not come away from
					the bowl until the last minute or so of kneading; it will be
					smooth and shiny and stick to your fingers. With an oiled
					spatula, scrape down any dough clinging to the sides of the
					bowl. If the dough is not stiff, knead in a little flour. If it
					is not at all sticky, spray it with a little water and knead it
					in. (The dough will weigh about 44.25 ounces/1258 grams.) 
					</P>
					<LI><P><EM>Hand Method</EM> Add the salt and butter to the bowl
					and, with a wooden spoon or your hand, stir until all the flour
					is moistened. Knead the dough in the bowl until it comes
					together, then scrape it onto a lightly floured counter. Knead
					the dough for 5 minutes, enough to develop the gluten structure
					a little, adding as little of the reserved flour as possible to
					keep the dough from sticking. Use a bench scraper to scrape the
					dough and gather it together as you knead it. At this point, it
					will be very sticky. Cover it with the inverted bowl and allow
					it to rest for 20 minutes. (This resting time will make the
					dough less sticky and easier to work with.) 
					</P>
					<LI><P>Knead the dough for another 5 minutes or until it is very
					smooth and elastic. It should still be tacky (sticky) enough to
					cling slightly to your fingers a little. If the dough is still
					very sticky, however, add some of the remaining reserved flour,
					or a little extra. (The dough will weigh about 44.25 ounces/1258
					grams.) 
					</P>
					<LI><P><EM>Both Methods</EM> <STRONG>4. Let the dough rise.</STRONG>
					Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough into a
					4-quart dough-rising container or bowl, lightly oiled with
					cooking spray or oil. Push down the dough and lightly spray or
					oil the surface. Cover the container with a lid or plastic wrap.
					With a piece of tape, mark the side of the container at
					approximately where double the height of the dough would be.
					Allow the dough to rise (ideally at 75&deg;to 80&deg;F) until
					doubled, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 
					</P>
					<LI><P>Using an oiled spatula or dough scraper, scrape the dough
					onto a floured counter and press down on it gently to form a
					rectangle. It will be full of air and resilient. Try to maintain
					as many of the air bubbles as possible. Pull out and fold the
					dough over from all four sides into a tight package, or give it
					2 business letter turns and set it back in the container. Again
					oil the surface, cover, and mark where double the height would
					now be. (It will fill the container fuller than before because
					it is puffier with air.) Allow the dough to rise for 1 to 2
					hours or until it reaches the mark. 
					</P>
					<LI><P><STRONG>5. Shape the dough and let it rise.</STRONG> Turn
					the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and cut it in half.
					Shape each piece into a loaf: begin by gently pressing the dough
					(or lightly rolling it with a rolling pin) into a wide
					rectangle; the exact size is not important at this point. (A
					long side of the dough should be facing toward you.) Dimple the
					dough with your fingertips to deflate any large bubbles. Fold
					over the right side of the dough to a little past the center.
					Fold over the left side of the dough to overlap it slightly.
					Press the center overlap section with the side of your hand to
					seal the dough. (If you have a lot of experience shaping, you
					may prefer at this point to rotate the dough 90 degrees&mdash;a
					quarter turn.) Starting at the top edge of the dough, roll it
					over three or four times, until it reaches the bottom edge of
					the dough: with each roll, press with your thumbs to seal it and
					at the same time push it away from you slightly to tighten the
					outer skin. As you roll and press, the dough will become wider.
					If it is not as long as the pan, place both hands close together
					on top of the dough and, rolling back and forth, gradually work
					your way toward the ends, gently stretching the dough. For the
					most even shape, it is important to keep a tight skin on the
					surface of the dough and not to tear it. If you want the edges
					of the loaf to be smooth, tuck the sides under. 
					</P>
					<LI><P>Place the loaves in the prepared loaf pans; the dough
					will be about 1/2 inch from the top of the pans. Cover them with
					a large container, or cover them loosely with oiled plastic
					wrap, and allow to rise until the center is about 1 inch above
					the sides of the pan, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. When the dough is
					pressed with a fingertip, the depression will very slowly fill
					in. 
					</P>
					<LI><P><STRONG>6. Preheat the oven. </STRONG>Preheat the oven to
					350&deg;F 45 minutes before baking. Have an oven shelf at the
					lowest level and place a baking stone or baking sheet on it, and
					a cast-iron skillet or sheet pan on the floor of the oven,
					before preheating. 
					</P>
					<LI><P><STRONG>7. Bake the bread.</STRONG> Quickly but gently
					set the pans on the hot baking stone or hot baking sheet. Toss
					1/2 cup of ice cubes into the pan beneath and immediately shut
					the door. Bake for 50 minutes or until medium golden brown and a
					skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean (an instant-read
					thermometer inserted into the center will read about 210&deg;F).
					Halfway through baking, turn the pans around for even baking. 
					</P>
					<LI><P><STRONG>8. Glaze and cool the bread.</STRONG> Remove the
					bread from the oven and set it on a wire rack. Brush the top of
					the bread with the optional melted butter. Unmold and cool top
					side up on a wire rack until barely warm, about 1 hour. 
					</P>
					<LI><P><STRONG>ULTIMATE FULL FLAVOR VARIATION </STRONG><BR>For
					the best flavor development, in Step 2, allow the sponge to
					ferment for 1 hour at room temperature and then refrigerate it
					for 8 to 24 hours. If using the hand mixing method, remove it
					from the refrigerator about 1 hour before mixing the dough. 
					</P>
					<LI><P><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><STRONG>POINTERS
					FOR SUCCESS</STRONG><BR>&bull; If not using the dry milk, you
					can replace 1 cup of the water with 1 cup milk, preferably

					<LI><P><STRONG>UNDERSTANDING</STRONG><BR>A greater amount of
					sponge dough starter (pre-ferment) offers a fuller flavor in
					this &ldquo;plain&rdquo; bread, so almost 50 percent of total
					amount of flour is used in the sponge, compared to the usual 30
					percent of hearth breads. 
					</P>
					<LI><P>If using liquid milk, it is scalded to deactivate the
					enzyme in it that could make the dough sticky. 
					</P>
					<LI><P>Baking the bread at too high a temperature, would result
					in too thin a crust, which would cause keyholing, or caving in
					at the sides of the loaf. Therefore, this bread is baked at
					350&deg;F. It is also important for the bread to be thoroughly
					baked so that the crust is firm enough to prevent it from
					compressing. The loaves should not be cut until completely cool
					for the same reason.
