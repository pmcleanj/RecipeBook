<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=4><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">You
will need a cider press, which can be jury-rigged from a scissor
style car jack, a few boards, and a slotted tray. Rig a frame with a
strong bottom platform about an inch larger than the tray you will be
using. Place the tray on the bottom of the frame, then the apples in
their case on the tray, then a board the same size as the tray, on
top of the apples, then the jack on top of the tray, pressing up
against the top of the frame. Place a bucket under the slot in the
tray to collect the juice.</SPAN></P>
