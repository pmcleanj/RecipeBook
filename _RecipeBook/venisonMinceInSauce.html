<P>This is a recipe for traditional Venison patties or sausages. The
sharp sauce blends well with the strong venison game meat and is an
ideal recipe in order to use up any left over meat.<BR><B>Venison
Sausages</B> 
</P>
<P><B>Ingredients:</B> <BR>1lb cooked venison (minced) <BR>1 small
onion (finely chopped) <BR>1/2 pint white sauce <BR>1 tablespoon
Scottish Mustard (Or French if unavailable) <BR>1 teaspoon white
sugar <BR>Dash Worcestershire sauce <BR>Salt &amp; Pepper - Seasoning
<BR>1 teaspoon horseradish sauce(optional) 
</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Method:</B> <BR>Preheat oven to 375F. Mix the minced venison
and onion, then season well. Form the mixture into round patties
(about 1-1&amp; 1/2 inches) or alternatively roll them into link
sausage shapes(round tubes). 
</P>
<P>Fry the patties gently in butter until they are brown on both
sides (or all over if tubes) and transfer to a small casserole dish.
Prepare the white sauce (if not premixed) and stir in the mustard,
sugar and worcestershire sauce. The teaspoon of horseradish is
optional as this may give the dish too much of a &quot;bite&quot;.
Pour the mixture over the sausages and bake for 30-35 minutes. 
</P>
<P>This dish should serve 4 people and traditionally would be served
with a potato dish of your choice. 
</P>
<P>As with all recipes which involve cooking and baking a sensible
approach must be taken especially when dealing with warm or hot
(temperature) ingredients. If you are unable to take due care, please
do not attempt to make any of these recipes. All recipes are tried at
your own risk.
