	<div class="step">
		<div class="ing">
		<p>250 grams white sugar</p>
		<p>100 ml water</p>
	 	OR, reserved syrup from Candied Ginger or Candied Peel and 125 ml
			white sugar.</p>

		<div class="dir">
			Combine in a small heavy smooth-surfaced saucepan such as glazed cast-iron, '
			placed on a large burner. Cover with silicone boil-over shield and bring to a 
			boil. Turn down to a simmer. Insert a candy thermometer through one of the 
			ports in the boil-over shield so that the tip is immersed in the liquid but
			is not touching the bottom of the pan. Cook to 250F.

		Lightly butter a marble candy-slab. Grind 10ml of sugar very, very fine in a 
		mortar and sprinkle evenly across the slab.

		<div class="ing">
		<p>10 ml butter</p>
		<p>1 to 2 drops flavouring essence</p>

		When the candy reads 250F, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in butter

		As soon as the candy is cool enough to handle, scrape it up into two lumps and 
		pull them like taffy, alternating between the lumps until they become easier to 
		handle. Divide the two lumps into four, and then eight, placing a single *small*
	 	drop of food colouring on each lump. </div>
	</div><div class="clear"></div>
	Alternate between thelumps pulling them until they begin to lighten in colour, 
	indicating that they are beginning to crystalize. Roll them rapidly into long thin 
	snakes. Quickly before they crystalize, snip the snakes with kitchen shears into small 
	“pillows” about a centimetre long.
