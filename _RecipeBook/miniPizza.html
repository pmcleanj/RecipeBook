					<LI><P>Take balls of dough one by
					one, and gently flatten them with your hands, then pull the
					edges gently to enlarge the circle until they are about 5cm on a
					side.&nbsp; Place them on the baking sheets a few cm apart.
					After you have finished all the rounds, it helps to start with
					the ones you did first as they had some resting time, and pick
					them up and stretch them a bit more if it looks they could use
					it.&nbsp; The dough will be easier to handle at this point &ndash;
					do not tear. Place the re-stretched pizza bases on the sheets
					(still spacing them out to allow for expansion), cover with
					cloth kitchen towels, and allow to rise for about 20 minutes.&nbsp;
					They will puff up visibly.

	(Ovens vary.&nbsp; Mine has the no-fan option which is what I use).&nbsp;
	Cover two baking sheets with baking parchment.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Prepare your toppings &ndash;
	shred cheese, cut tomatoes, scizzor slices of chorizo or salami into
	1cm square-ish bits.&nbsp; Put in the fridge (mostly for sake of
	cheese here, so that it doesn&rsquo;t get warm and soggy).

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Brush each round with a little bit
	of olive oil, leaving approximately 1-cm margin (this is roughly, if
	you splat oil around it&rsquo;s not a problem of any sort), and then
	top with a few squares of salami or chorizo, and a couple of strips
	of sundried tomato.&nbsp; Or whatever else you like.

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Sprinkle with dried oregano and
	grind a little bit of black pepper on top.&nbsp; Add a small heap of
	shredded hard cheese onto the middle of each pizza. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Place sheets in the oven.&nbsp; I
	did this sequentially, but you could also up the temperature to
	210&deg;C and put both sheets in, and swap them top to bottom
	halfway through baking.&nbsp; Bake for about 10 minutes, but watch
	the pizzas the entire time &ndash; as I&rsquo;ve mentioned many
	times, ovens vary and I do not know yours!&nbsp; The cheese can burn
	really quickly if you leave them in. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>When pizzas are puffed up more, crust is golden and the
	cheese is melted and golden as well, take out and cool on a rack.&nbsp;
	These are fine to serve warm or at room temperature &ndash; they get
	a wonderfully crunchy crust when they cool down just a little.
