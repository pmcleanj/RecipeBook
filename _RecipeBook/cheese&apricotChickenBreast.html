				Cut a deep pocket in each of the chicken breasts, and stuff
				with the Stilton and dried apricots. Use the bacon to wrap each
				chicken breast up and to hold them together. Place in a casserole
				dish, season with salt and pepper, and pour the wine over them.
				Bake in oven for 25 minutes.While this is happening, whiz
				the cottage cheese in a blender just until it is smooth.Drain
				the liquid in the casserole dish into a saucepan and simmer for a
				couple of minutes over a gentle heat. Thicken with the cottage
				cheese to the desired consistency, and heat for a minute or
				two.Serve the chicken breasts with the sauce spooned over
				them.
