Mix the minced venison and onion, then season well. Form the mixture into round patties (about 1-1&amp; 1/2 inches) or alternatively roll them into link sausage shapes(round tubes). </P> <P>Fry the patties gently in butter until they are brown on both sides (or all over if tubes) and transfer to a small casserole dish. Prepare the white sauce (if not premixed) and stir in the mustard, sugar and worcestershire sauce. The teaspoon of horseradish is optional as this may give the dish too much of a &quot;bite&quot;. Pour the mixture over the sausages and bake for 30-35 minutes. </P> <P>This dish should serve 4 people and traditionally would be served with a potato dish of your choice. </P> <P>As with all recipes which involve cooking and baking a sensible approach must be taken especially when dealing with warm or hot (temperature) ingredients. If you are unable to take due care, please do not attempt to make any of these recipes.
