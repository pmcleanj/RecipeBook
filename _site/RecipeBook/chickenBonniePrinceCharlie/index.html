This recipe includes that classic Scottish liqueur, Drambuie. According to legend the recipe for this rather wonderful honey-flavoured drink was given to the MacKinnon clan in gratitude for their help after Culloden. It is this that the dish is named after. Ingredients: 4 skinned chicken breasts 3 tbsp Drambuie 125ml chicken stock 250ml double cream 90g butter 30g slivered almonds, toasted 4 apples, peeled, cored, and cut into thick slices flour for dusting salt and black pepper Celtnet recipes chicken recipe divider Chicken Bonnie Prince Charlie Preparation: Method: Season a little flour and use this to dust the chicken breasts. Melt the butter in a pan and use this to fry the chicken on both sides until well browned. Add the Drambuie and chicken stock, bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 10 minutes. Meanwhile prepare the apples and fry in a little butter until fairly soft (do not stir as you don't want apple sauce!). When done set aside. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside to keep warm. Add a little more Drambuie to the stock left in the pan then stir-in the cream. Heat through, but avoid boiling then add the toasted almonds. Plate-out the chicken, cover with the sauce then garnish with the fried apples. Serve immediately.<BR><BR>Read more at Celtnet: <A HREF="http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/miscellaneous/fetch-recipe.php?rid=misc-chicken-bonnie-prince-charlie">http://www.celtnet.org.uk/recipes/miscellaneous/fetch-recipe.php?rid=misc-chicken-bonnie-prince-charlie</A><BR>Copyright &copy; celtnet</P> <P><BR><BR> </P> </BODY> </HTML></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
