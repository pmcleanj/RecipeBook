The central course, normally the roast course, is the focus of the meal: serve the same number of courses before the roast as after; serve the same number of courses in the salon before the meal, as in the drawing room after the meal. Alternate sweet or tart dishes with savoury dishes, taking thought to how each taste transitions to the next.</P><h4>The letters after each course heading indicate how fundamental is the course. Thus, for a three-course meal, use all of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; courses: Soup, Roast and Dessert. For a 5-course meal, use the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B&rdquo;courses: Appetizer, Soup, Roast, Salad, Dessert; and so on.</P> <H1>Canapes</A>(C)</H1> <H1><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Canap&#279;s are &ldquo;finger-food&rdquo; hors d'Ouevres, being made on top of a thin slice of firm bread or a cracker. Since they do not require cutlery, they are properly served in the Salon where guests are gathering before the meal. Cocktails may be served to drink. The hostess should strive to be present in the Salon to greet her guests as they arrive. Four to eight guests, in addition to the host and hostess, are the perfect number for an intimate formal meal: no more than the Muses and no fewer than the Graces. If more guests are expected, the hostess should stand by the door and receive guests as they arrive, to spare them from having to search her up in the crowd, and to ensure that they are introduced at once to two or three of their fellow guests, and provided with refreshments as well as conversational partners.</H1> <H1">When all the Guests have arrived, the hostess may announce &ldquo;Dinner is served&rdquo;, or if she has domestic staff then her head-of-staff may announce to her &ldquo;Madam is served&rdquo;. Then the hostess, escorted by the guest of honour, will lead her guests into the dining room and direct them where to sit. The gentlemen hold chairs for the ladies, and do not themselves sit down until all the ladies are seated.</H1> <H1 CLASS="heading-2-western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#333333"><FONT SIZE=7><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal"><A HREF="Appetizers.html">Appetizer</A> (B)</SPAN></H1> <H1 CLASS="heading-2-western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.02in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Although canap&#279;s may have been served in the Salon, a more substantial appetizer &ndash; often shellfish such as oysters or shrimp &ndash; can also be served at the table. The shrimp- or oyster-fork goes to the right of the spoons in the place setting. (All the other forks are on the left of the place setting.) The appetizer itself should be sitting on the service plates when the guests are seated; so a cold appetizer, not at risk of becoming lukewarm while it waits, is a good choice.</SPAN></H1> <H1 CLASS="heading-2-western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=7 STYLE="font-size: 40pt"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal"><A HREF="Soups.html">Soup</A> (A)</SPAN></H1><h4 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.02in; font-weight: normal; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">The tureen, with a stack of soup-plates beside it, may be standing next to the hostess's place while the appetizers are being enjoyed. </P><h4 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.02in; font-weight: normal"><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">With soup, serve sherry in sherry glasses, which are smaller than wine-glasses.</P> <H1 CLASS="heading-2-western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#666666"><FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 28pt"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal"><A HREF="Fish.html">Fish</A> (D)</SPAN></H1><h4 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.02in; font-weight: normal; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">With fish, serve white wine in small wine-glasses.</P> <H1 CLASS="heading-2-western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT SIZE=6 STYLE="font-size: 22pt"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal"><A HREF="Roasts.html">Entree</A> (E)</SPAN></H1> <H1 CLASS="heading-2-western" ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Small specialty meats leading up to the main meat course, such as fowl and venison, may be served in order to create eleven- or more, even twenty-one course meals.</H1> <H1 CLASS="heading-2-western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT SIZE=7 STYLE="font-size: 40pt"><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal"><A HREF="Roasts.html">Roast</A> (A)</SPAN></H1><h4 ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.02in; font-weight: normal; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto"> <FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">Often incorrectly called the &ldquo;Entr&#279;e&rdquo;,.the &ldquo;R&ocirc;ti&rdquo; course is the feature course of the meal.
