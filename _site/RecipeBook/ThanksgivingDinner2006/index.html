My parents divorced in the summer of 1980, and that Christmas it became clear that my &ldquo;childhood home&rdquo; simply didn't exist. Unlike some university students, I did <FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt"><U>not</U> <FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">find my old room kept shrine-like for my return: the house had moved on, and it was patently time for me to move on, too. The following Christmas I remember spending Christmas eve watching Kramer vs. Kramer at the moviedome, and eating Christmas dinner as guest of my boyfriend's mother. After graduation, I resolved the problem by cooking holiday dinners myself and sharing them with other young singles in similar family circumstances. I created <a href="ChristmasDinner1984.html">Christmas Dinner 1984</A> folloowing the third of those dinners, which I dedicated to my dinner guests of the evening</P> <P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.5in"><FONT SIZE=4 STYLE="font-size: 16pt">After I married, we carried on the Christmas dinners &ndash; we had always held them on a later day within the Twelve Days to allow guests to fulfill family obligations and command performances &ndash; but fell into the habit of having Thanksgiving dinner with my in-laws. This year, Dean's parents' travel schedule didn't allow his mother to cook a large dinner, and in a fit of generosity or lunacy, I volunteered to cook. So, for Anne and Rachel who will someday be inheriting the role of cook and chatelaine in this household or in some other, I offer this collection of recipes.</P> <a href="pumpkinGingerSoup.html">Pumpkin Soup</A></P> <a href="biscuits.html">Biscuits</A></P> Roast Turkey</P> Onion Stuffing</P> Turkey Gravy</P> <a href="yorkshirePudding.html">Yorkshire Pudding</A></P> Grilled Peppers and Zuchinni</P> <a href="SweetPotatoCasserole.html">Sweet Potato Casserole</A></P> Mashed Potatos</P> Spinach Salad</P> Carrot-Raisin Salad</P> <a href="pumpkinPie.html">Pumpkin Pie</A></P> <a href="applePie.html">Apple Pie</A></P> <a href="breadPudding.html">Bread Pudding</A></P> <a href="lemonSlice.html">Lemon Slice</A></P> <a href="blondeBrownies.html">Blond Brownies</A></P> </BODY> </HTML></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; Pamela Mclean 2019</footer><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
