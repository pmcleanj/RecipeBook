<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Ingredients375 g dates, pitted
and chopped
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">1 3/4 cups water1.5 teaspoons
baking soda3/4 cup butter, softened1/2 cup granulated sugar6
egg yolks1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 2/3 cups all purpose
flour.5 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons baking powderc
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">IngredientsFor the Sauce
(for 1 cake):1/2 pound butter1 cup brown sugar (8
ounces)1/2 cup heavy cream1 teaspoon vanilla extractVanilla
ice cream or whipped cream, for servingPreheat the oven to
350 degrees F. Butter and flour two 9-inch-round cake pans or 20
muffin tins.Place the dates in large saucepan with 3 1/2 cups
cold water. Bring to boil, stirring a little to break up the dates.
Then leave to simmer for 1 minute before removing from the heat. Stir
in the baking soda (which will cause the mixture to bubble
up).Cream the butter and sugar together in a food mixer until
pale and creamy. Add the eggs, one at a time, occasionally scraping
down mixing bowl. Add the vanilla extract and then the flour and salt
and mix briefly to give a lumpy dough.Next, add the warm date
mixture in two batches. Scrape down the sides of bowl in between
mixing. The dough will now be quite watery but don't worry! Finally
add the baking powder (this will bubble up also).Pour the
batter evenly into the two pans or muffin tins. Bake for about 30 to
40 minutes for cake pans and about 20 minutes for muffin tins. Test
if they are cooked with a small knife or toothpick, it should come
out clean when cakes are done.Meanwhile, to make the sauce,
combine the butter, brown sugar, heavy cream and vanilla extract in a
medium saucepan. Bring to boil and then reduce to simmer gently for a
minute or two until thickened and well blended.When the cakes
are done, poke little holes all over with toothpick, this will enable
the sauce to be absorbed more easily. Pour the caramel sauce over
cakes while both are still warm and leave to soak for about 10
minutes. Turn the cakes out upside-down onto serving plates (the
bottom is the most sticky bit!).Serve with vanilla ice cream
or whipped creamRead more at:
