three parts. Put dough on floured board, roll out into long strip.
Dot first third of fats on top third of pastry strip. Fold over like
an envelope as when making flaky pastry. Roll out, repeat with other
strips until all butter mixture is used up. Roll out, cut in small
oval shapes or rounds. Lay on floured baking sheet, leave 2 inches
between each to allow for expansion. Cover as above, let rise 3/4
