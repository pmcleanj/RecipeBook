Turkish Delight<br>
      </p>
      <p>rind of 1 medium lemon<br>
        rind of 1 medium orange<br>
        1/4 cup (2 fl oz) orange juice<br>
        2 tablespoons lemon juice<br>
        3 cups caster sugar (superfine)<br>
        1/2 cup (4 oz) water<br>
        2 tablespoons gelatine<br>
        1 cup (8 fl oz) water, extra<br>
        2/3 cup cornflour (cornstarch)<br>
        3-4 drops orange or rose flower water<br>
        red food colouring<br>
        1/2 cup icing (confectioners) sugar</p>
      <p>Line base and sides of a deep 17 cm (6 3/4 inch) square cake tin<br>
        with aluminum foil, leaving edges overhanging. Brush foil with oil<br>
        or melted butter. Remove white pith from rinds.</p>
      <p>Combine rinds, juices, sugar and water in large heavy-based pan.<br>
        Stir over medium heat without boiling until sugar has completely<br>
        dissolved. Brush sugar crystals from side of pan with a wet pastry<br>
        brush. Bring to boil, reduce heat slightly and boil without stirring<br>
        for 5 minutes or boil until a teaspoon of mixture dropped into cold<br>
        water forms long threads, or if using a sugar thermometer it must<br>
        reach 105 C (221 F). Combine gelatine with 1/2 cup (4 fl oz) extra<br>
        water in bowl. Stir over hot water until dissolved. In separate<br>
        bowl combine cornflour with remaining water, mix until smooth.</p>
      <p>Add gelatine and cornflour mixtures to sugar syrup. Stir over medium 
        heat until mixture boils and clears. Stir in flower water and a few drops 
        red food colouring. Strain mixture into tin; refrigerate over night. When 
        set peel off foil and cut into squares. Roll in icing sugar.</p>
