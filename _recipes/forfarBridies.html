				<P><FONT COLOR="#800000"><I><B>These are said to have been made
				by a travelling food seller, Maggie Bridie of Glamis (in the days
				when the county of Angus was called Forfarshire). They were
				mentioned by J M Barrie (author of Peter Pan) who was born in
				Kirriemuir in that county. The original recipe used suet but
				since that is not always to everyone's taste, you can use butter
				or margarine.</B></I>

				<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Ingredients (for six bridies):</B> <BR>1&frac12;
				lbs (700g) boneless, lean rump steak. Lean minced beef can also
				be used. <BR>2 oz (2 rounded tablespoons) suet or butter or
				margarine <BR>1 (or 2) onion, chopped finely <BR>1 teaspoon dry
				mustard powder <BR>Quarter cup rich beef stock <BR>Salt and
				pepper to taste <BR>1&frac12; lbs flaky pastry (home made or from
				a pastry mix packet) 
				</BLOCKQUOTE>
				<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Method:</B> <BR>Remove any fat or gristle from the
				meat and beat with a meat bat or rolling pin. Cut into half-inch
				(1cm) pieces and place in a medium bowl. Add the salt/pepper,
				mustard, chopped onion, suet (or butter/margarine) and stock and
				mix well. <BR>Prepare the pastry and divide the pastry and meat
				mixture into six equal portions. Roll each pastry portion into a
				circle about six inches in diameter and about quarter of an inch
				thick and place a portion of the mixture in the centre. Leave an
				edge of pastry showing all round. Brush the outer edge of half
				the pastry circle with water and fold over. Crimp the edges
				together well. The crimped edges should be at the top of each
				bridie. Make a small slit in the top (to let out any steam).
				Brush a 12 inch square (or equivalent area) baking tray with oil
				and place the bridies in this, ensuring that they are not
				touching. Place in a pre-heated oven at 450F/230C/gas mark 8 for
				15 minutes then reduce the temperature to 350F/180C/gas mark 4
				and cook for another 45/55 minutes. They should be golden brown
				and if they are getting too dark, cover with greaseproof paper
				(vegetable parchment).
