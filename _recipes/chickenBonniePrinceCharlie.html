<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Chicken Bonnie Prince Charlie Recipe
from Scotland Origin: Scotland Period: Traditional This is a
traditional Scottish recipe for a classic dish of chicken breasts
cooked in a mix of chicken stock and Drambuie that's finished with
double cream, apples, butter and slivered almonds. This recipe
includes that classic Scottish liqueur, Drambuie. According to legend
the recipe for this rather wonderful honey-flavoured drink was given
to the MacKinnon clan in gratitude for their help after Culloden. It
is this that the dish is named after. Ingredients: 4 skinned chicken
breasts 3 tbsp Drambuie 125ml chicken stock 250ml double cream 90g
butter 30g slivered almonds, toasted 4 apples, peeled, cored, and cut
into thick slices flour for dusting salt and black pepper Celtnet

Preparation: Method: Season a little flour and use this to dust the
chicken breasts. Melt the butter in a pan and use this to fry the
chicken on both sides until well browned. Add the Drambuie and
chicken stock, bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 10 minutes.
Meanwhile prepare the apples and fry in a little butter until fairly
soft (do not stir as you don't want apple sauce!). When done set
aside. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside to keep warm.
Add a little more Drambuie to the stock left in the pan then stir-in
the cream. Heat through, but avoid boiling then add the toasted
almonds. Plate-out the chicken, cover with the sauce then garnish
with the fried apples. Serve immediately.<BR><BR>Read more at
