				<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Method:</B> <BR>The beef and pork should not be
				too lean or the sausage may be too dry. <BR>Mix really well by
				hand then place in an oblong pan about 10&quot; x 4&quot; x 3&quot;.
				You might need two pans. Place in the freezer for a little while
				till it's just starting to set. Remove it and cut them to the
				thicknes you like and put them into freezer bags and put them
				back in the freezer. When required, defrost and fry in a little
				fat or oil until brown and cooked through.
